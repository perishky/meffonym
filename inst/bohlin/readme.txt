According to Bohlin, et al.:

"There are two similar models that can be chosen for gestational age
prediction. The first (and default) sets the Lasso penalty parameter
lambda to be within one standard error of minimum. The second model
uses the minimum lambda. While the latter of these two models might
give slightly improved predictions, the former requires fewer
CpGs. Since the quality of the gestational age predictions is
practically the same for both models the model that retains less CpGs
is default (i.e. type='se')."
